1. What is a server?
   A server is a device or software that runs applications, stores data, and provides services to other computers connected to it over a network.

2. What is the role of the domain name?
   Domain names are human-readable text that help internet users access websites or services without having to remember their long IP addresses.

3. What type of DNS record is "www" in "www.foobar.com"?
   The "www" record is a subdomain and is called a CNAME record. It points to the server's IP address.

4. What is the role of the web server?
   The web server handles client requests and serves them the appropriate webpages within responses, just like our Nginx here.

5. What is the role of the application server?
   The application server is responsible for processing the dynamic content of the website. It executes code (e.g., PHP) to retrieve/update/delete data from the database. The processed content is then sent to the web server for delivery to the user.

6. What is the role of the database?
   The database stores and manages a collection of the website's data.

7. How does the server communicate with the user's computer requesting the website?
   The server uses a communication protocol called HTTP or HTTPS.

Issues with this infrastructure:
- Single Point of Failure (SPOF): With only one server, the entire website may become inaccessible if that server goes down.
- Downtime during maintenance: Deploying new code requires restarting the web server, causing downtime for end users.
- Limited Scalability: The single server setup can't handle a significant increase in traffic without adding more resources.
